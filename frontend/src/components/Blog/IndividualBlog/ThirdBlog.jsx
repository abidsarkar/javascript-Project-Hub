            At Frontend Practice, we believe there is great value in recreating
            real websites as a form of coding practice. With our large
            collection of hand-picked projects to choose from, there's something
            for everyone, no matter your skill level. <br /> <br /> One
            advantage of this particular type of coding practice is that you can
            use any technology you prefer, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or
            your favorite framework or library.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900">
            To get started:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 text-xl">
            Create a new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file and begin recreating the
            web pages that are featured in our projects. If you prefer to work
            with a specific framework or library, you can install the package of
            your choice with the command line and start building.
            <br />
            <br />
            Each project on Frontend Practice comes with a recommended course
            and helpful resources, including color palettes, reference images,
            and links to free photo assets and icons.
            <br />
            <br />
            We also provide a list of what you can learn from each project and
            unique challenges specific to each project, making it easy for you
            to focus on the skills you want to improve.
          </p>

            If you're just starting with frontend development, we recommend
            starting with the Level 1 projects, which focus on basic layouts,
            color choices, and simple animations. As you progress, you can move
            on to Level 2 projects, which offer a wider variety of designs,
            interactive elements, and more advanced animations.
            <br />
            <br />
            And if you're feeling confident and ready to push your skills to the
            next level, you can tackle the Level 3 projects, which are some of
            the most complex and challenging projects on the site.
